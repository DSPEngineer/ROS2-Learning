# <p style="text-align: center;">Learning ROS2 using C++</p>

This repository serves to capture lessons learned as I progress through various ROS2 tutorials. I began my foray into ROS2 using Ubuntu 22.04 with ROR2 Humble (Humble Hawksbill release).

I have since moved on to Ubuntu 24.04 and ROS2 Jazzy (Jazzy Jalisco release). I will refer to and derive examples from the Jazzy.

```

## Where to find additional ROS2 tutorials:
These tutorials served as my initial starting point for learning ROS2. I will add the link to these tutorials as reference for the inquisitive reader.

```

## Base Development Environment
These examples were based on ROS2 Jazzy. Jazzy require Ubuntu 24.04 as your base linux. FOr those who cannot update to Ubuntu 22.04 I have create a separate project to produce Docker containers to support Humble/22.04 and Jazzy/24.04 which include VS Code, compilers, libraries, DDS and various ROS2 learning tools.
